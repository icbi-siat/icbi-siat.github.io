- title: "Dendritic mitoflash as a putative signal for stabilizing long-term synaptic plasticity"
  image: fu_tan_nc.jpg
  description: We find that induction of late-phase sLTP at synaptic spines is associated with a preceding increase in mitoflash frequency occurring in nearby dendritic shafts, whereas mitoflash activity remains unaltered during induction of only short-term spine enlargement.

- title: Quantitative analysis of vesicle recycling at the calyx of Held synapse
  image: qiu_pnas.jpg
  description: our study quantified the kinetics of vesicle recycling and kinetically dissected the whole vesicle pool in the calyceal terminal into the readily releasable pool (∼0.6%), the readily priming pool (∼46%), the premature pool (∼33%), and the resting pool (∼20%).

- title: "Mesophasic organization of GABA A receptors in hippocampal inhibitory synapses"
  image: em-1-s.jpg
  description: Information processing in the brain depends on specialized organization of neurotransmitter receptors and scaffolding proteins within the postsynaptic density. However, how these molecules are organized in situ remains largely unknown. In this study, template-free classification of oversampled sub-tomograms was used to analyze cryo-electron tomograms of hippocampal synapses. We identified type-A GABA receptors (GABAARs) in inhibitory synapses and determined their in situ structure at 19-Å resolution. These receptors are organized hierarchically&#58; from GABAAR super-complexes with a preferred inter-receptor distance of 11nm but variable relative angles, through semi-ordered, two-dimensional receptor networks with reduced Voronoi entropy, to mesophasic assembly with a sharp phase boundary. These assemblies likely form via interactions among postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and receptors and align with putative presynaptic vesicle release sites. Such mesophasic self-organization might allow synapses to achieve a Goldilocks state, striking a balance between stability and flexibility and enabling plasticity in information processing.
